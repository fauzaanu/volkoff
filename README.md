# Volkoff

Volkoff helps you lock and unlock your files. It's like a safe for your computer files!

To get Volkoff, type this:
```bash
pip install volkoff
```

To start it, just type:
```bash
vk
```

## How It Works

When you lock a file:
1. Volkoff makes a special key just for you
2. It saves what kind of file it is (like a picture or text)
3. It locks up your file with the key
4. It gives you the key to save

When you want to unlock it:
1. You give Volkoff your key
2. It checks if the key is right
3. It unlocks your file
4. You get your file back, just like it was before

Remember:
- Keep your key safe! Without it, you can't unlock your files
- Write down your key somewhere safe
- Test unlocking right after you lock something important
